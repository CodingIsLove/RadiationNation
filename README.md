# RadiationNation

This is a game, we develop for the Web Engineering Course at our university of applied sciences

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

The Installation Manual can be found in the [Installation Guide (Wiki)](https://github.com/CodingIsLove/RadiationNation/wiki/Installation-Guide).

## Deployment

We have deployed RadiationNation in our Local Network. For that we used 2 Raspberry Pi's (1x Backend / 1x Frontend). Then we opened Ports and forwarded them to run it and possibly accessing it remotely.

## Technologies used

A full list of technologies used, architecture of the game and of the network protocol can be found in the [Stack, Architecture and Protocol (Wiki)](https://github.com/CodingIsLove/RadiationNation/wiki/Stack,-Architecture-and-Protocol).
